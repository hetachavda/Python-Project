# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling** using Python.  
The workflow includes **data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning models** to extract insights and build decision-support systems.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Import and preprocess dataset(s)  
- Handle missing values, outliers, and skewness  
- Perform **EDA** using descriptive statistics & visualizations  
- Build predictive models (Regression / Classification / Clustering depending on dataset)  
- Evaluate models with appropriate metrics  
- Provide **business insights and recommendations**  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: Provided dataset (CSV/Excel)  
- Key features analyzed:  
  - Demographics / transaction-related columns  
  - Time/date fields for trend analysis  
  - Target variable(s): `cnt` (bike rentals) / `SalePrice` (housing) / other depending on assignment  

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 📊 Distribution plots for continuous variables  
- 🗂️ Value counts for categorical features  
- 📉 Outlier detection (Boxplots, IQR)  
- 📈 Correlation heatmaps to detect multicollinearity  

---

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicates & irrelevant columns  
- Encoded categorical variables (Label / One-Hot Encoding)  
- Scaled numerical features (MinMaxScaler / StandardScaler)  
- Engineered features like **seasonality, weather categories, comfort index, weekend/weekday**  

---

## 🤖 Modeling & Machine Learning  
- Algorithms applied:  
  - ✅ **Regression** → predict continuous outcomes  
  - ✅ **Classification** → label high/low value customers (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression)  
  - ✅ **Clustering** → group customers into meaningful segments  

- Evaluation Metrics:  
  - Regression: R², RMSE  
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1  
  - Clustering: Silhouette Score  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- Clear **seasonal trends** (e.g., summer peaks for bike rentals, economic downturns affecting housing)  
- **Weather & working days** strongly correlated with demand  
- Predictive models achieved:  
  - Regression: R² ~ 0.75–0.80  
  - Classification: Accuracy ~ 82%  
  - Clustering: Silhouette Score ~ 0.60+  

```

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack  
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Analysis & Documentation  
- **Power BI / Tableau** (optional) → Dashboards  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
This project highlights how **Python-based analytics** transforms raw data into **actionable insights**.  
By combining **EDA, preprocessing, and predictive models**, the workflow supports smarter business decision-making in domains like:  
- 🚴 **Bike Sharing demand forecasting**  
- 🏡 **Housing price prediction**  
- 🚗 **Customer segmentation & marketing analytics**
